# TreeTees T-Shirt Shop

##### The Iron Yard - Week 3, Day 1

For this assignment we were to take the cart functionality from our previous Tailored T-Shirt Shop assignment and apply it to a full t-shirt shop. I created a fictitious t-shirt shop called TreeTees, and utilized parallax scrolling effects and slideup overlays to create a modern looking website.
